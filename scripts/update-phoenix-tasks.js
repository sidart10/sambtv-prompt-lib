3. Add environment variables to .env.local
4. Run 'docker-compose up -d'
5. Verify Phoenix is accessible at http://localhost:6006`,
    mvpApproach: "Use Phoenix's Docker image as-is, no custom builds needed",

    title: "Phoenix Auth Bridge - Simple JWT",
    description: "Create a minimal authentication bridge that converts NextAuth sessions to Phoenix JWTs.",

3. Include user id, email, name, and expiration in the token
4. No complex RBAC needed for MVP - Phoenix will handle its own permissions`,
    mvpApproach: "Skip complex RBAC, just pass user info to Phoenix",
    timeEstimate: "2-4 hours",

   - prompt_evaluations: Links prompts to Phoenix evaluation IDs
   - prompt_traces: Links prompts to Phoenix trace IDs
2. Store only the Phoenix reference IDs, not the actual data
3. Let Phoenix handle all the complex data storage
4. Run migration in Supabase dashboard`,

2. Extract session, generate Phoenix token, forward requests
3. Handle all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
4. Add error handling for failed requests
5. Skip GraphQL federation - just use REST`,
    mvpApproach: "Simple REST proxy, skip GraphQL complexity",
    timeEstimate: "4-6 hours",
    testStrategy: "Make various API calls through the proxy and verify responses match direct Phoenix calls."

2. Add Phoenix views to your app:
   - /evaluations page with embedded evaluation dashboard
   - /traces page with trace explorer
   - Trace panel in playground
3. Style iframes to match your app's design
4. Phase 2: Optionally replace iframes with Phoenix React components later`,
    mvpApproach: "Start with iframes for full features immediately",
    timeEstimate: "1-2 days",

    details: `1. Install socket.io-client
2. Create simple connection function that passes auth token
3. Listen for Phoenix events (evaluation updates, trace completion)
4. Update UI or trigger refetches when events arrive
5. No need to implement complex event handling - just connect and listen`,
    mvpApproach: "Use Phoenix's WebSocket as-is, just connect and listen",

2. Implement token caching to reduce auth overhead
3. Add loading skeletons while Phoenix content loads
4. Create basic smoke tests for critical paths
5. Skip complex performance optimization for MVP`,

2. Conditionally show Phoenix features based on flag
3. Update production docker-compose with Phoenix services
4. Create a simple README for Phoenix features
