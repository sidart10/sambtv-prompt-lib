# Evaluation System - Future Enhancements

This document outlines features that were deferred from the initial evaluation system implementation to meet compressed timeline requirements.

## 1. Human Annotation Queue System

### Overview
A system for human reviewers to manually evaluate and annotate AI responses when automated evaluation is insufficient.

### Technical Requirements
- **Queue Management**: Priority-based task queue for human reviewers
- **Reviewer Interface**: Web UI for annotators to view prompts/responses and provide scores
- **Assignment System**: Intelligent task distribution based on reviewer expertise
- **Quality Control**: Inter-annotator agreement metrics and calibration
- **Integration**: Seamless blend of human and automated evaluations

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE annotation_tasks (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  prompt_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  response_content TEXT NOT NULL,
  priority INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  assigned_to UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'in_progress', 'completed', 'skipped')),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  due_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);

CREATE TABLE human_evaluations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  task_id UUID REFERENCES annotation_tasks(id),
  evaluator_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  scores JSONB NOT NULL,
  comments TEXT,
  time_spent_seconds INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## 2. Advanced Evaluator Types

### Multi-Modal Evaluators
- Support for evaluating image + text responses
- Audio transcription quality assessment
- Video content moderation

### Domain-Specific Evaluators
- **Code Quality**: Syntax checking, best practices, security vulnerabilities
- **Medical Content**: Accuracy verification with medical knowledge bases
- **Legal Compliance**: Regulatory compliance checking
- **Educational**: Pedagogical effectiveness scoring

### Custom Evaluator Builder
- Visual interface for creating custom evaluation criteria
- Rule-based evaluator templates
- Integration with external APIs for specialized checks

## 3. Enhanced Scoring Systems

### Weighted Multi-Criteria Scoring
- User-configurable weight matrices
- Contextual weight adjustment based on use case
- Hierarchical scoring with sub-criteria

### Confidence Intervals
- Statistical confidence bands for scores
- Uncertainty quantification
- Bayesian score updates with more data

### Calibration Systems
- Score normalization across evaluators
- Historical baseline comparisons
- Drift detection and correction

## 4. Advanced A/B Testing Features

### Statistical Significance Testing
- Proper sample size calculations
- Multiple hypothesis correction
- Bayesian A/B testing option

### Multi-Variant Testing
- Support for 3+ variants simultaneously
- Factorial experiment design
- Bandits for automatic traffic allocation

### Segmentation Analysis
- User cohort-based evaluation
- Geographic/demographic breakdowns
- Time-based analysis (peak vs off-peak)

## 5. Real-Time Evaluation Pipeline

### Streaming Evaluations
- Evaluate responses as they stream
- Early stopping for poor quality
- Progressive quality indicators

### Evaluation Webhooks
- Real-time notifications for evaluation results
- Integration with external monitoring systems
- Automated action triggers based on scores

## 6. Advanced Analytics & Reporting

### Evaluation Dashboards
- Real-time evaluation metrics
- Historical trend analysis
- Comparative analysis across models/prompts

### Export Capabilities
- Detailed evaluation reports (PDF, Excel)
- API for programmatic access
- Integration with BI tools

### ML-Based Insights
- Automatic pattern detection in evaluations
- Predictive quality modeling
- Anomaly detection for outliers

## 7. Evaluation Data Management

### Version Control for Evaluations
- Track evaluator version changes
- Retroactive re-evaluation capabilities
- Evaluation history and audit trails

### Data Retention Policies
- Configurable retention periods
- GDPR-compliant data handling
- Archival and retrieval systems

## 8. Integration Enhancements

### LangChain/LlamaIndex Integration
- Direct evaluation within chains
- Evaluation-based routing
- Quality gates in pipelines

### Model Provider Integrations
- Direct integration with OpenAI Evals
- Anthropic Constitutional AI alignment
- Custom model provider evaluations

### CI/CD Integration
- Automated evaluation in deployment pipelines
- Quality gates for prompt changes
- Regression testing for prompts

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority** (Next Phase)
   - Human annotation queue (partially started)
   - Statistical significance for A/B tests
   - Basic evaluation dashboards

2. **Medium Priority** 
   - Domain-specific evaluators
   - Advanced scoring systems
   - Real-time evaluation pipeline

3. **Low Priority** (Long-term)
   - Multi-modal evaluators
   - ML-based insights
   - Full CI/CD integration

## Technical Debt to Address

1. **Rate Limiting**: Move from in-memory to Redis-based solution
2. **Caching**: Add caching layer for evaluation results
3. **Background Processing**: Move heavy evaluations to job queue
4. **Monitoring**: Add comprehensive logging and metrics

## Estimated Timeline

- Phase 2 (1-2 months): High priority items
- Phase 3 (3-4 months): Medium priority items  
- Phase 4 (6+ months): Low priority items and ongoing improvements
