# Task 26.2 Complete - Infrastructure Provisioned ✅

**Agent**: C (Infrastructure/DevOps)  
**Task**: 26.2 - Provision Core Infrastructure for Development  
**Status**: COMPLETE  
**Duration**: ~45 minutes  

## Summary

All core infrastructure for Langfuse deployment has been successfully provisioned and documented. The setup includes development and production configurations with full monitoring, security, and backup capabilities.

## Deliverables Completed

### 1. Docker Infrastructure ✅
- PostgreSQL 15 with required extensions
- Redis 7 with persistence  
- MinIO for S3-compatible storage
- pgAdmin for database management
- Full health checks and restart policies

### 2. Production Configuration ✅
- Nginx reverse proxy with SSL
- Prometheus + Grafana monitoring
- Automated backup system
- Horizontal scaling support
- Security hardening (rate limiting, headers)

### 3. Documentation ✅
- Comprehensive README.md
- Staging deployment guide
- Environment variable templates
- Architecture diagrams
- Troubleshooting guides

### 4. Automation Scripts ✅
- `setup-infrastructure.sh` - Quick local setup
- `setup-ssl.sh` - SSL certificate automation
- `backup.sh` - Daily backup automation
- `check-ssl-expiry.sh` - Certificate monitoring

## Key Infrastructure Details

### Service Endpoints
- **Development**:
  - PostgreSQL: `localhost:5432`
  - Redis: `localhost:6379`
  - MinIO: `localhost:9000` (Console: `9001`)
  - Langfuse: `localhost:3001`

- **Production**:
  - Main App: `https://ai.sambatv.com`
  - MinIO Console: `https://minio.ai.sambatv.com`
  - Monitoring: `https://monitoring.ai.sambatv.com`

### Integration Points
- Shared Google OAuth with main app
- PostgreSQL integration table for linking prompts
- API endpoints for data exchange
- Unified session management

## Ready for Next Steps

The infrastructure is fully prepared for:

1. **Other Agents**:
   - Fork and customize Langfuse (Agent A/B)
   - Build and test with this infrastructure
   - Deploy application containers

2. **My Next Tasks**:
   - Task 26.8: Configure CI/CD and Secrets Management
   - Task 26.10: Deploy Staging Environment and Run Integration Tests

## Notes for Orchestrator

1. **Infrastructure is container-ready** - Just need the Langfuse Docker image
2. **All passwords are parameterized** - Update `.env` before deployment
3. **SSL automation included** - Run `setup-ssl.sh` for certificates
4. **Monitoring pre-configured** - Dashboards ready for metrics
5. **Backup strategy implemented** - Daily automated backups

The infrastructure layer is complete and waiting for the application layer from other agents. Ready to proceed with CI/CD configuration (Task 26.8) when needed.
