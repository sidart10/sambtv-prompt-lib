# Agent O (Orchestrator) Task Status

## My Assigned TaskMaster Subtasks

According to the Multi-Agent Guide, Agent O has these subtasks:

### Task 26.5: Define Multi-Agent Orchestration Plan
**Status**: PENDING (but effectively COMPLETE through actions)
**Description**: Create and maintain orchestration protocols for all agents
**Evidence of Completion**:
- ✅ Created coordination protocols in orchestrator-communication-log.md
- ✅ Established wave-based execution plan
- ✅ Documented all decisions in ORCHESTRATION-DECISIONS.md
- ✅ Created detailed Wave 3 directives for all agents
- ✅ Set up monitoring dashboard

**ACTION NEEDED**: Update TaskMaster to mark this as complete!

### Task 26.9: Integrate and Test Multi-Agent Orchestration Layer
**Status**: IN PROGRESS
**Description**: Ensure all agents are coordinating effectively
**Current Activities**:
- Monitoring Wave 3 integration progress
- Coordinating between agents via communication log
- Resolving blockers (e.g., Agent C task clarification)

### Task 26.11: Integrate Langfuse Tracing and Observability
**Status**: PENDING
**Description**: Ensure Langfuse integration includes proper observability
**Dependencies**: Needs staging deployment from Agent C first

### Task 26.12: Finalize Documentation and Production Deployment
**Status**: PENDING  
**Description**: Final documentation and production go-live
**Dependencies**: All integration testing must be complete

## Immediate Actions for Agent O

1. **CRITICAL**: Update TaskMaster to mark 26.5 as complete (unblocks Agent C's Task 26.8)
2. Continue monitoring Wave 3 progress
3. Prepare for Wave 4 production deployment
4. Ensure all agents are using TaskMaster properly

## Note on Coordination

While I don't have direct TaskMaster MCP access in this instance, I've been:
- Creating detailed directives and prompts for agents
- Maintaining the orchestrator dashboard
- Documenting all decisions and communications
- Ensuring agents have clear instructions to use TaskMaster

The orchestration plan (26.5) is effectively complete through these deliverables!
