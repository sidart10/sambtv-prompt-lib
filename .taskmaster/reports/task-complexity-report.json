      "taskId": 13,
      "taskTitle": "Comments and Feedback Section",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 10,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the comments and feedback section into granular backend, frontend, and integration tasks. Include database schema design, API development, UI components for comment display and input, markdown support, nested replies, editing/deletion, sorting, pagination, notifications, and moderation features. Ensure each subtask is testable and can be assigned independently.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple interconnected features (threaded comments, markdown, notifications, moderation, etc.) across backend and frontend, requiring careful coordination and robust testing. The presence of nested replies, real-time updates, and moderation increases both cyclomatic and structural complexity, justifying a high score and a need for detailed subtasks."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 14,
      "taskTitle": "Version History Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose the version history implementation into subtasks covering database schema for versioning, backend logic for tracking and restoring versions, UI components for history display and navigation, diff comparison, metadata presentation, and notification integration. Include testing and documentation steps.",
      "reasoning": "Version tracking requires careful data modeling, UI/UX for diffing and navigation, and integration with notifications. While not as interactive as comments, it involves non-trivial backend logic and user-facing features, making it moderately complex and suitable for multiple subtasks."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 17,
      "taskTitle": "Leaderboard Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the leaderboard implementation into subtasks for backend metric aggregation, database queries, frontend leaderboard page and components, category tabs, time filters, badge logic, data refresh, and animation handling. Include UI/UX review and testing.",
      "reasoning": "The leaderboard requires aggregation queries, multiple UI states, and gamification elements. While mostly read-heavy, the need for real-time updates, animations, and badge logic adds moderate complexity, warranting several focused subtasks."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 19,
      "taskTitle": "Notifications System",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 9,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the notifications system into subtasks for database schema, event generation logic, backend API endpoints, frontend dropdown and detail views, read/unread status, badge updates, notification preferences, and integration with other modules. Include comprehensive testing for all notification types.",
      "reasoning": "Notifications touch many parts of the system, require real-time or near-real-time updates, and must handle multiple event types and user preferences. The cross-cutting nature and need for reliability and scalability make this a high-complexity task."

    {
      "taskId": 30,
      "taskTitle": "Update Analytics Class for Database Integration",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the analytics class update into subtasks for reviewing the schema, refactoring each analytics method, implementing error handling and transactions, utility query methods, documentation, rate limiting/batching, index verification, and comprehensive testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves refactoring core analytics logic, integrating with multiple tables, ensuring data integrity, and supporting admin dashboard queries. The need for error handling, performance considerations, and backward compatibility increases its complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 31,
      "taskTitle": "AI Model Pricing Configuration and Cost Calculation System",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the AI model pricing system into subtasks for pricing config file creation, cost calculation utilities, AI client integration, backend API updates, frontend cost display components, compatibility checks for all models, documentation, and multi-level testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task spans configuration, backend logic, and frontend display, with a need for accuracy and extensibility across multiple AI models. Integration with analytics and the admin dashboard, as well as user-facing cost transparency, adds to its moderate-to-high complexity."
