```

## Escalation Procedures

### Blocker Resolution
1. Identify the blocking issue
2. Determine affected agents
3. Create resolution plan
4. Communicate to all agents
5. Track resolution progress

### Integration Conflicts
1. Stop affected work streams
2. Analyze conflict root cause
3. Design compatibility solution
4. Update integration contracts
5. Resume development
