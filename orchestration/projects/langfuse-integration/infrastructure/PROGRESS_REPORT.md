## Infrastructure Ready for Deployment ðŸš€

All core infrastructure components are configured and ready. The setup includes:

- **Development Environment**: Quick local setup with `./setup-infrastructure.sh`
- **Production Environment**: Full production stack with monitoring and backups
- **Security**: SSL, rate limiting, and network isolation
- **Scalability**: Support for horizontal scaling and replication
- **Integration**: Ready to connect with forked Langfuse application

## Next Steps

1. **For Other Agents**:
   - Fork Langfuse repository (Agent A/B)
   - Apply white-label customizations
   - Build Docker image
   - Test with this infrastructure

2. **For Agent C (Me)**:
   - Wait for Langfuse fork completion
   - Deploy to staging environment (Task 26.10)
   - Configure CI/CD pipelines (Task 26.8)
   - Set up production domain and SSL

## Service Endpoints

- PostgreSQL: `localhost:5432` (dev) / Internal only (prod)
- Redis: `localhost:6379` (dev) / Internal only (prod)
- MinIO API: `localhost:9000` (dev) / `https://s3.ai.sambatv.com` (prod)
- MinIO Console: `localhost:9001` (dev) / `https://minio.ai.sambatv.com` (prod)
- pgAdmin: `localhost:8080` (dev only)
- Langfuse App: `localhost:3001` (dev) / `https://ai.sambatv.com` (prod)
- Grafana: `https://monitoring.ai.sambatv.com` (prod, internal only)

## Notes for Orchestrator

The infrastructure is fully prepared and documented. All services are containerized with proper health checks, monitoring, and backup strategies. The setup supports both development and production environments with easy scaling options.

Ready to proceed with staging deployment once the Langfuse fork is complete!
