# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - SambaTV Internal Prompt Library

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Overview
This document outlines the product requirements for the **SambaTV Internal Prompt Library**, a web platform designed to centralize the discovery, creation, sharing, and testing of AI prompts for internal use by SambaTV employees. The platform aims to enhance productivity, foster collaboration, and standardize prompt engineering practices within SambaTV. It will draw inspiration from best-in-class public prompt libraries like `shumerprompt.com` but will be tailored to SambaTV's specific needs, branding, and security requirements.

### 1.2. Goals
- To provide a centralized, searchable repository for high-quality AI prompts relevant to SambaTV projects.
- To enable SambaTV employees to easily test, iterate, and optimize prompts using a dedicated Playground environment.
- To foster a community of practice around prompt engineering within SambaTV through features like leaderboards and prompt sharing.
- To ensure all prompts and related data are securely stored and accessible only to authorized SambaTV personnel.
- To reflect SambaTV's branding and integrate seamlessly with its existing internal tools and authentication systems (Enterprise Google OAuth).

## 2. Target Users
- SambaTV employees across various departments (Engineering, Data Science, Product, Marketing, etc.) who utilize AI models requiring text-based prompts.

## 3. Core Features

### 3.1. Homepage / Explore Prompts
- **Branding:** Prominently display the SambaTV logo.
- **Search & Filtering:**
    - Robust keyword search for prompts (title, description, content, tags).
    - Advanced filtering options (e.g., by AI model, category/use-case, creation date, author, popularity, tags).
- **Prompt Listing:**
    - Card-based or list view of prompts, showing title, a brief description, author, key stats (uses, likes/votes), and tags.
    - Clear indication of featured or "verified" prompts by SambaTV subject matter experts.
- **Prompt Detail View:**
    - Full prompt content with easy copy-to-clipboard functionality.
    - Detailed description, use-case examples, author information, and version history (if applicable).
    - User ratings/comments section for feedback and discussion.
    - "Use in Playground" button.
    - Shareability options within SambaTV (e.g., link, send to colleague).

### 3.2. Playground
- **Purpose:** Allow users to test prompts with various configurations and AI models relevant to SambaTV's stack.
- **Interface:**
    - Input area for the prompt.
    - System prompt input area (if applicable).
    - Variable input fields if the prompt template supports them.
    - Model selection dropdown (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude, internal SambaTV models).
    - **Generation Settings:**
        - Sliders/input fields for parameters like Temperature, Max Tokens, Top P, Frequency Penalty, Presence Penalty.
        - Presets for common generation configurations.
    - Output display area with formatting options and copy-to-clipboard.
    - "Run" button with clear loading/error states.
    - Ability to save Playground sessions or iterations.
- **Usage Tracking:** Log prompt usage and parameters for analysis (anonymized where appropriate).

### 3.3. Leaderboard
- **Purpose:** Showcase popular, effective, or highly-rated prompts to encourage discovery and recognize contributions.
- **Ranking Criteria:**
    - Based on usage frequency, user upvotes/likes, or expert ratings.
    - Filterable by time period (e.g., weekly, monthly, all-time).
- **Display:** Clear ranking, prompt title, author, and key metrics.

### 3.4. User Authentication & Profile (SambaTV Internal)
- **Authentication:** Mandatory login via SambaTV's Enterprise Google OAuth.
- **User Profile (Future):**
    - View user's submitted prompts.
    - Saved/favorited prompts.
    - Basic profile information from Google (name, SambaTV email).

### 3.5. Prompt Submission & Management (Future - for contributors)
- **Submission Form:** Easy-to-use form for submitting new prompts with fields for title, description, prompt content, tags, target model, etc.
- **Moderation/Approval Workflow:** (Optional) For maintaining quality and relevance.

### 3.6. Upgrade / Premium Features (Internal Context)
- While `shumerprompt.com` has an "Upgrade" page for paid tiers, for an internal SambaTV tool, this section might be re-purposed or omitted.
- **Possible Internal "Upgrade" interpretations:**
    - Access to more powerful internal models in the Playground.
    - Higher rate limits for prompt generation.
    - Access to advanced analytics on prompt performance.
    - This could be tied to user roles or team budgets within SambaTV, rather than monetary payment. For now, assume a single tier of access for all SambaTV employees.

## 4. User Stories

### 4.1. As a SambaTV Employee (General User):
- I want to easily find relevant prompts for my task using search and filters, so I can save time and improve my AI model interactions.
- I want to view the full details of a prompt, including its content and usage guidelines, so I can understand how to use it effectively.
- I want to quickly test a prompt in the Playground with different settings and models, so I can see its output and iterate on it.
- I want to see which prompts are popular or highly-rated on a Leaderboard, so I can discover effective prompts used by my colleagues.
- I want to log in securely using my SambaTV Google account, so I don't need to manage another set of credentials.
- I want to copy prompt text easily, so I can use it in other applications.

### 4.2. As a SambaTV Employee (Prompt Contributor - Future):
- I want to submit my own effective prompts to the library, so I can share them with my colleagues and contribute to SambaTV's knowledge base.
- I want to tag and categorize my prompts, so they are easily discoverable.

### 4.3. As a SambaTV Admin (Future):
- I want to manage users and their access levels, so I can ensure security and proper usage.

    - Secure authentication via SambaTV Enterprise Google OAuth.
    - All data (prompts, user info) stored securely within SambaTV's approved infrastructure (Supabase configured for SambaTV's needs).
    - Protection against unauthorized access or data breaches.
- **Scalability:** The backend (Supabase) should handle a growing number of users and prompts within SambaTV.

## 6. Future Considerations
- Version control for prompts.
- Advanced prompt collaboration features (e.g., team-specific prompt collections).
- Integration with other internal SambaTV tools or AI model APIs.
- More sophisticated analytics and reporting for prompt performance.
- Gamification elements to encourage contribution and engagement.
