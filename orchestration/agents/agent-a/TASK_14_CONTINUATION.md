# Agent A - Task 14 Continuation Directive

**OUTSTANDING WORK on Task 2! Now continuing Task 14 with Agent B coordination.**

---

```markdown
You are Agent A (Frontend/UI) continuing your excellent work on the SambaTV AI Platform.

## üéâ CONGRATULATIONS: Task 2 Complete!
Your SambaTV branding implementation is excellent and ready for Agent R review. You've established the visual foundation perfectly.

## üéØ CURRENT MISSION: Complete Task 14 - Advanced Playground Features

### **CURRENT PROGRESS (Excellent!):**
‚úÖ **Subtask 14.1 Complete**: UI Components Built
- `/lib/outputParser.ts` - Comprehensive JSON/XML/structured parser ‚úÖ
- `/components/playground/StructuredOutputDisplay.tsx` - Interactive tree display ‚úÖ  
- `/components/playground/StreamingDisplay.tsx` - Real-time streaming with metrics ‚úÖ

### **NEXT PHASE: Subtask 14.2 - Integration & API Connection**

## üîó IMMEDIATE COORDINATION WITH AGENT B

Agent B has completed ALL backend APIs and is standing by to support you. You need to coordinate on:

### **1. Streaming API Requirements:**
Ask Agent B for:
- Server-Sent Events endpoint specifications
- Real-time streaming API format
- Token-by-token streaming implementation
- Cancellation/abort mechanisms

### **2. Structured Output Specifications:**
Coordinate with Agent B on:
- Which models support JSON schema validation
- XML output capabilities by provider
- Structured format parsing requirements
- Error handling for malformed outputs

### **3. Model Provider Capabilities:**
Agent B discovered a sophisticated 34+ model system. Get details on:
- Which models support structured outputs
- Parameter configurations for each provider
- Rate limiting and quota considerations
- Cost implications for streaming vs standard requests

## üõ†Ô∏è YOUR IMPLEMENTATION TASKS (Subtask 14.2):

### **Step 1: Playground Integration**
```typescript
// Update your playground page to include:
import { StructuredOutputDisplay } from '@/components/playground/StructuredOutputDisplay'
import { StreamingDisplay } from '@/components/playground/StreamingDisplay'
import { parseOutput } from '@/lib/outputParser'

// Integrate components into main playground UI
```

### **Step 2: Streaming API Endpoint**
Work with Agent B to implement:
- `/api/playground/stream` endpoint with Server-Sent Events
- Real-time token streaming from model providers
- Proper error handling and connection management
- Stream cancellation capabilities

### **Step 3: Structured Output Integration**
- Connect your parser to the generation flow
- Add UI controls for output format selection (JSON/XML/Raw)
- Implement real-time parsing and display
- Handle parsing errors gracefully

### **Step 4: Model Integration Testing**
Test with Agent B's model system:
- Verify streaming works with all 34+ models
- Test structured output parsing across providers
- Validate cost calculations and metrics
- Ensure proper error handling

## üìã COORDINATION PROTOCOL:

### **Message Agent B:**
```
[Agent A] Task 14 Coordination Request

I've completed the UI components for advanced playground features:
- StructuredOutputDisplay component ‚úÖ
- StreamingDisplay component ‚úÖ  
- Output parser library ‚úÖ

I need your API specifications for:
1. Streaming endpoint format and Server-Sent Events
2. Model capabilities for structured outputs (JSON/XML)
3. Integration testing with your 34+ model system
4. Error handling and rate limiting considerations

Ready to integrate when you provide the API details!
```

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR TASK 14:

### **Required Features:**
- ‚úÖ Structured output support (JSON, XML) - UI Complete
- ‚úÖ Real-time streaming display - UI Complete  
- ‚è≥ Server-Sent Events streaming - Needs Agent B API
- ‚è≥ Model provider integration - Needs Agent B coordination
- ‚è≥ Error handling and cancellation - Implementation pending
- ‚è≥ Performance metrics display - Integration pending

### **Quality Standards:**
- Responsive design maintaining SambaTV branding
- Proper TypeScript typing throughout
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance optimized (lazy loading, memoization)
- Accessible components (WCAG compliance)

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:

1. **Contact Agent B** - Get API specifications for streaming and structured outputs
2. **Integrate Components** - Add your built components to main playground page
3. **Implement API Layer** - Build the streaming endpoint with Agent B's guidance
4. **Test Integration** - Verify everything works with the model system
5. **Submit for Review** - Send to Agent R when complete

## üìä CURRENT PROJECT STATUS:
- **Your Work**: Task 2 ‚úÖ | Task 14 (80% complete) üîÑ
- **Agent B**: All APIs ready, supporting your integration
- **Agent C**: Infrastructure ready for deployment
- **Agent R**: Reviewing completed work, will review Task 14 when ready

## ü§ù TEAM COORDINATION:
- **Agent B**: Actively supporting your Task 14 needs
- **Agent C**: Infrastructure ready for your playground deployment
- **Agent R**: Will review Task 2 and Task 14 completion
- **Agent O**: Monitoring integration progress

**You're doing excellent work! The playground features will be a showcase of the SambaTV AI Platform capabilities.**

---

**START IMMEDIATELY:**
1. Message Agent B for API coordination
2. Begin integrating your components into the main playground
3. Work with Agent B on streaming implementation
```
