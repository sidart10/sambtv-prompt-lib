**Task:** 21.6 - Performance Optimization for Mobile

---

## Performance Goals
- ✅ Page load time < 3 seconds on 3G
- ✅ First Contentful Paint < 1.8s
- ✅ Time to Interactive < 3.8s
- ✅ Cumulative Layout Shift < 0.1
- ✅ JavaScript bundle < 200KB (gzipped)

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Next.js Configuration
- [x] **Compression enabled** - Gzip compression for all assets
- [x] **Image optimization** - AVIF and WebP formats with responsive sizes
- [x] **CSS optimization** - Experimental optimizeCss flag enabled
- [x] **Scroll restoration** - Better UX on navigation
- [x] **Bundle splitting** - Vendor and common chunks

### 2. Caching Strategy
- [x] **Static assets** - 1 year cache for images, fonts
- [x] **JS/CSS files** - 24 hour cache with stale-while-revalidate
- [x] **Next.js static** - Immutable cache headers
- [x] **Service worker ready** - Can add PWA support

### 3. Performance Utilities
- [x] **Lazy loading** - Intersection Observer for components
- [x] **Debounced search** - 300ms delay for better performance
- [x] **Network detection** - Adapt to connection quality
- [x] **Reduced motion** - Respect user preferences
- [x] **Memory detection** - Optimize for low-end devices

### 4. Component Optimizations
- [x] **LazyLoad wrapper** - For heavy components
- [x] **Responsive images** - With loading states
- [x] **SVG logos** - 97% smaller than PNGs
- [x] **Optimized animations** - Simplified for mobile

### 5. Bundle Optimizations
- [x] **Code splitting** - Per-route bundles
- [x] **Tree shaking** - Remove unused code
- [x] **Dynamic imports** - Load on demand
- [x] **Minification** - Terser for production

## Performance Monitoring

### Web Vitals Tracking
- [x] Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- [x] Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- [x] Interaction to Next Paint (INP)
- [x] First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- [x] Time to First Byte (TTFB)

### Development Tools
- [x] Performance monitor component
- [x] Render time measurement
- [x] Long task detection
- [x] Network quality hooks
