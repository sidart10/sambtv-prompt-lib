# Corrected Multi-Agent Orchestration Plan for Langfuse Integration

## Overview
Based on the PRD and integration plans, the actual work involves:
1. **Option A**: Fork Langfuse and deploy as white-labeled "SambaTV AI Platform" (1-2 days)
2. **Option B**: Integrate Langfuse features into existing app (1-2 weeks)

The PRD strongly recommends **Option A** for speed and completeness.

## Current State Analysis
Looking at your existing codebase:
- ✅ Prompt Library is fully built (Next.js, Supabase, Google OAuth)
- ✅ Playground already exists and works well
- ✅ User management, categories, tags all functional
- ✅ Analytics tracking is in place
- ❌ Missing: Evaluation, tracing, experiments, datasets, human annotation

## Recommended Approach: Fork & Deploy (Option A)

### Why This Approach?
- Get ALL Langfuse features in 1-2 days
- Minimal code changes to existing app
- Production-ready from day one
- Easy to maintain and update

## Agent Task Distribution for Fork & Deploy

2. Ensure authentication works seamlessly
3. Validate integration points
4. Manage deployment sequence
5. Conduct end-to-end testing
6. Create documentation

## Detailed Wave Plan

### Wave 1: Foundation (4 hours)
**Parallel Execution:**

**Agent A:**
- Fork Langfuse repository
- Identify all branding touchpoints
- Prepare SambaTV assets (logos, colors)

**Agent B:**
- Review Langfuse auth configuration
- Plan session sharing strategy
- Map API integration points

**Agent C:**
- Set up local development environment
- Configure Docker setup
- Plan infrastructure requirements

**Integration Checkpoint:** All agents sync on approach

### Wave 2: Core Implementation (6 hours)
**Parallel Execution:**

**Agent A:**
- Replace all Langfuse branding
- Update theme colors and styles
- Modify UI text and metadata
- Test responsive design

**Agent B:**
- Configure Google OAuth
- Implement domain restrictions
- Set up API keys for models
- Create data linking logic

**Agent C:**
- Set up PostgreSQL database
- Configure development deployment
- Set up subdomain and SSL
- Create deployment scripts

**Integration Checkpoint:** Test auth flow end-to-end

### Wave 3: Integration & Testing (4 hours)
**Parallel Execution:**

**Agent A:**
- Add integration buttons to main app
- Ensure consistent navigation
- Create unified header/footer
- Polish UI transitions

**Agent B:**
- Test cross-app data flow
- Implement prompt ID passing
- Verify model configurations
- Create fallback handling

**Agent C:**
- Deploy to staging environment
- Configure production domain
- Set up monitoring/alerts
- Optimize performance

**Integration Checkpoint:** Full system test

### Wave 4: Production & Documentation (2 hours)
**All Agents:**
- Final production deployment
- Create user documentation
- Conduct team training
- Monitor initial usage

## Critical Integration Points

### 1. Authentication
- Both apps MUST use same Google OAuth credentials
- Session must be shared seamlessly
- Domain restriction must be consistent

### 2. Data Flow
```typescript
// Main App → Langfuse
{
  promptId: number,
  promptContent: string,
  userId: string,
  modelPreference: string
}

// Langfuse → Main App
{
  traceId: string,
  evaluationScores: object,
  totalCost: number,
  latency: number
}
```

### 3. URL Structure
- Main App: `https://prompts.sambatv.com`
- Langfuse: `https://ai.sambatv.com`
- Shared auth: `https://prompts.sambatv.com/api/auth`

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- [ ] Langfuse deploys with SambaTV branding
- [ ] Single sign-on works seamlessly
- [ ] Data flows between systems
- [ ] All models are configured
- [ ] Performance meets targets

### User Success
- [ ] Users see consistent experience
- [ ] "Test in AI Platform" button works
- [ ] Evaluation data displays in main app
- [ ] No authentication friction
- [ ] Intuitive navigation

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues & Solutions

1. **Auth Session Sharing**
   - Risk: Sessions might not sync
   - Solution: Use shared Redis or database session store

2. **CORS Issues**
   - Risk: Cross-origin requests blocked
   - Solution: Properly configure CORS headers

3. **Database Performance**
   - Risk: Two databases might be slow
   - Solution: Use connection pooling and caching

4. **Branding Inconsistency**
   - Risk: Some Langfuse branding remains
   - Solution: Systematic search and replace

## Orchestrator Monitoring Points

### Hour-by-Hour Checkpoints

**Hour 1-2:** Environment setup complete
**Hour 3-4:** Branding changes verified
**Hour 5-6:** Auth integration tested
**Hour 7-8:** Staging deployment working
**Hour 9-10:** Production ready
**Hour 11-12:** Documentation complete

## Alternative: Integration Approach (Option B)

If you choose integration instead of forking:

### Adjusted Agent Tasks
**Agent A:** Build evaluation UI components from scratch
**Agent B:** Integrate Langfuse SDK and APIs deeply
**Agent C:** Handle Langfuse cloud connection or self-hosting

### Timeline
- 2-3 weeks instead of 1-2 days
- More custom code to maintain
- Cherry-pick features instead of getting all

## Recommendation

**Strongly recommend the Fork & Deploy approach** because:
1. 10x faster implementation (1-2 days vs weeks)
2. Get ALL features, not just selected ones
3. Battle-tested code from day one
4. Easy to pull upstream updates
5. Less code to maintain

## Next Steps

1. **Decision:** Confirm Fork & Deploy approach
2. **Initialize:** Set up 4 agent conversations with corrected directives
3. **Execute:** Follow the wave plan above
4. **Monitor:** Orchestrator ensures smooth integration
5. **Deploy:** Go live in 1-2 days!

This plan aligns with your actual PRD and integration requirements, focusing on rapid deployment of Langfuse as a white-labeled platform.
