## 🎯 Project-Specific: Langfuse Integration
Located in `projects/langfuse-integration/`:
- Infrastructure setup and configuration
- Project-specific prompts and directives
- Backend and frontend customization
- Authentication and model provider configuration

## 📊 Monitoring & Tracking
The `monitoring/` folder contains:
- XML progress tracking files
- Real-time agent progress logs
- Template files for progress reporting

## 🔧 Scripts & Automation
The `taskmaster-scripts/` folder contains:
- Progress update automation scripts
- TaskMaster integration utilities

## 🧭 Navigation Tips

1. **Starting a new agent session?** → Check `agents/{agent-name}/` for specific prompts
2. **Need coordination guidance?** → See `coordination/` folder
3. **Looking for current status?** → Check `active/` folder
4. **Research past decisions?** → Browse `historical/` folder
5. **Working on Langfuse?** → Navigate to `projects/langfuse-integration/`

## 🔄 File Relationships

### Critical Dependencies
- Agent prompts reference coordination documents
- Project files may reference agent-specific documentation
- Active guides supersede historical versions
- Configuration files in projects/ may be referenced by scripts

### Safe to Move/Edit
- All `.md` files can be safely reorganized
- Historical documentation is archived and stable
- Agent-specific prompts are self-contained

### Handle with Care
- XML monitoring files (actively updated)
- Configuration files (.ts, .json) in projects/
- Scripts in taskmaster-scripts/

## 📝 Maintenance Notes

This organization was created on January 11, 2025, to improve navigation and maintainability of the multi-agent orchestration system documentation. The structure separates:

1. **Active vs Historical** - Current operational docs vs archived content
2. **Agent-Specific vs General** - Individual agent instructions vs coordination
3. **Project-Specific vs Framework** - Langfuse implementation vs general orchestration

All moves were done safely, avoiding any code-breaking changes by only relocating `.md` documentation files and maintaining all technical configuration files in their original locations.
