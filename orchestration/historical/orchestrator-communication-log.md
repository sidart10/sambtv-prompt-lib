#### Communication #7 - ORCHESTRATOR STRATEGY UPDATE
- **Time**: 16:45
- **From**: Orchestrator
- **To**: All Agents
- **Subject**: Revised Integration Strategy Based on Progress
- **Message**: 
  ```
  [Agent O] Strategic Update - Excellent Progress!
  
  CURRENT STATUS:
  - Agent B: Backend integration COMPLETE (no fork needed!) ✅
  - Agent C: Infrastructure COMPLETE ✅
  - Agent A: Pending Langfuse fork for UI customization
  
  REVISED APPROACH:
  Since Agent B built the integration layer without forking:
  1. We can potentially use Langfuse Cloud OR self-host
  2. Integration APIs are ready to connect either way
  3. Focus shifts to Agent A for UI white-labeling
  
  CRITICAL PATH NOW:
  - Agent A must fork and white-label Langfuse UI
  - OR we consider using Langfuse Cloud with custom domain
  - Agent B's APIs can work with either approach
  
  Agent A Options:
  1. Fork Langfuse for full white-label control
  2. Use Langfuse Cloud + custom domain + CSS overrides
  3. Build minimal UI wrapper using Agent B's APIs
  
  Please advise on preferred approach, Agent A.
  Infrastructure and backend are ready to support any option.
  ```
- **Action Required**: Yes
- **Resolution**: Awaiting Agent A decision on UI approach

- **Message**: 
  ```
  [Agent O] CRITICAL WORKFLOW UPDATE - 5-Agent System Now Active!
  
  NEW TEAM MEMBER: Agent R (Code Review & Quality Assurance)
  
  ENHANCED WORKFLOW:
  Agent A/B/C: Code → Agent R: Review → Agent O: Integration
  
  MANDATORY CHANGES:
  1. All agents must set task status to 'review' when code is complete
  2. Agent R will provide detailed feedback before approval
  3. Only Agent R-approved code proceeds to integration
  4. Agent O waits for Agent R approval before advancing waves
  
  IMMEDIATE PRIORITY - RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW:
  Agent R must review already completed tasks that bypassed review:
  - Task 26.1: Fork Repository (Agent A) ✅ → Needs R Review
  - Task 26.2: Infrastructure (Agent C) ✅ → Needs R Review  
  - Task 26.4: Backend Prep (Agent B) ✅ → Needs R Review
  - Task 26.7: Custom Logic (Agent B) ✅ → Needs R Review
  
  UPDATED TASK STATUS WORKFLOW:
  ```bash
  # When completing work:
  set_task_status --id=X.Y --status=review  # Submit for review
  
  # Agent R reviews and either:
  set_task_status --id=X.Y --status=done       # Approved
  set_task_status --id=X.Y --status=in-progress # Needs fixes
  ```
  
  QUALITY BENEFITS:
  - Security vulnerabilities caught before production
  - Code quality standards enforced across all agents
  - Integration conflicts prevented through early detection
  - Knowledge sharing improves team capabilities
  
  Agent R is being initialized with retrospective review mission.
  All future work must go through Agent R quality gates.
  
  This establishes enterprise-grade quality assurance! 🎯
  ```
