# Quick Start: Langfuse Integration Multi-Agent Orchestration

## What We're Actually Building

Based on your PRD documents, we're **forking Langfuse** and deploying it as "SambaTV AI Platform" to add evaluation and observability features to your existing prompt library.

## The Real Work (Not the Task Complexity Report)

### What You Already Have âœ…
- Full prompt library app (Next.js + Supabase)
- Working playground with all features
- User authentication (Google OAuth)
- Categories, tags, search, everything works

### What We're Adding ðŸš€
- Fork Langfuse â†’ "SambaTV AI Platform"
- White-label with your branding
- Deploy at ai.sambatv.com
- Add "Test in AI Platform" buttons
- Show evaluation scores in main app

## Timeline: 1-2 Days (Not Weeks!)

### Day 1 Morning (4 hours)
- Fork Langfuse repo
- Replace branding
- Configure auth
- Set up models

### Day 1 Afternoon (4 hours)
- Add integration buttons
- Deploy to staging
- Test everything
- Fix any issues

### Day 2 (If needed)
- Production deployment
- Team training
- Documentation

## Agent Assignments

### Agent A (Frontend)
- White-label Langfuse UI (logos, colors, text)
- Add integration buttons to main app
- Ensure visual consistency

### Agent B (Backend)
- Configure Google OAuth
- Set up model APIs
- Create data integration

### Agent C (Infrastructure)
- Set up deployment
- Configure domain/SSL
- Handle DevOps

### Agent O (Orchestrator)
- Coordinate the above
- Ensure integration works
- Handle blockers

## Key Files to Use

1. **Read These First:**
   - `/docs/SAMBATV_AI_PLATFORM_PRD.md` - The main plan
   - `/docs/LANGFUSE_FORK_DEPLOY_PLAN.md` - Technical details
   - `/orchestration/langfuse-integration/agent-directives-langfuse.md` - Your specific tasks
   - `/orchestration/langfuse-integration/wave-plan-langfuse.xml` - Timeline

2. **Ignore These:**
   - The task complexity report (wrong project)
   - The original orchestration files I created
   - Any mention of Phoenix

## Simple Success Criteria

1. Langfuse runs with SambaTV branding
2. Users can click "Test in AI Platform" 
3. It opens their prompt in Langfuse
4. Evaluation scores show in main app
5. Same login works for both

## Start Commands

```bash
# First thing each agent does:
git clone https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse.git sambatv-ai-platform
cd sambatv-ai-platform
pnpm install

# Then follow your specific agent directives
```

## Why This Approach?

Your PRD makes it clear:
- **Fork gives us everything** in 1-2 days
- **Integration would take weeks** for partial features
- **Langfuse is designed** to be white-labeled
- **Less code to maintain** long-term

## Questions?

The orchestrator (Agent O) is here to help. We're building exactly what's in your PRD - a white-labeled Langfuse that integrates with your existing prompt library.
