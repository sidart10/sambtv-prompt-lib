# Start Multi-Agent Orchestration

## Prerequisites
1. All agents have access to this repository
2. Each agent has read the relevant documentation
3. Integration contracts are defined
4. Wave execution plan is finalized

## Starting the Orchestration

### Step 1: Initialize Agents
Provide each agent with their directive file:
- Agent A: `/orchestration/agents/agent-a-frontend.md`
- Agent B: `/orchestration/agents/agent-b-backend.md`
- Agent C: `/orchestration/agents/agent-c-infrastructure.md`

### Step 2: Share Wave Plan
All agents should read: `/orchestration/waves/wave-execution-plan.xml`

### Step 3: Begin Wave 1
Each agent should:
1. Identify their Wave 1 tasks
2. Create task breakdown
3. Start implementation
4. Report progress regularly

### Step 4: Orchestrator Monitoring
As the orchestrator, you should:
1. Monitor progress files in `/orchestration/monitoring/`
2. Check integration points regularly
3. Resolve conflicts and blockers
4. Validate quality at checkpoints
5. Coordinate wave transitions

## Communication Protocol

### Progress Reporting Format
```xml
<progress_report agent="[A/B/C]" wave="1" timestamp="ISO_8601">
  <task_id>TASK_NUMBER</task_id>
  <status>in_progress|completed|blocked</status>
  <completion_percentage>75</completion_percentage>
  <current_activity>Implementing OAuth flow</current_activity>
  <blockers>None</blockers>
  <next_steps>Test domain restrictions</next_steps>
  <integration_ready>false</integration_ready>
</progress_report>
```

### Integration Checkpoint Format
```xml
<integration_check wave="1" timestamp="ISO_8601">
  <component>Authentication</component>
  <agents_involved>A,B</agents_involved>
  <status>ready|pending|failed</status>
  <tests_passing>true|false</tests_passing>
  <issues>List any integration issues</issues>
  <resolution>Proposed fixes</resolution>
</integration_check>
```

## Quality Assurance Checklist

Before approving work from any agent:
- [ ] Code follows project standards
- [ ] Integration contracts are honored
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance targets met

## Wave Transition Criteria

To move from one wave to the next:
1. All agents complete assigned tasks
2. Integration tests pass
3. Quality gates satisfied
4. No critical blockers
5. Orchestrator approval

## Emergency Procedures

If critical issues arise:
1. Pause all agent work
2. Assess impact and scope
3. Create remediation plan
4. Communicate to all agents
5. Resume with adjusted plan
