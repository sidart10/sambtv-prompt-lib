## Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Check agent progress
cat orchestration/monitoring/agent-*-progress.xml

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Check deployment status
docker-compose ps

# View error logs
docker-compose logs --tail=100
```

## Escalation Procedures

### Blocker Resolution
1. Identify the blocking issue
2. Determine affected agents
3. Create resolution plan
4. Communicate to all agents
5. Track resolution progress

### Integration Conflicts
1. Stop affected work streams
2. Analyze conflict root cause
3. Design compatibility solution
4. Update integration contracts
5. Resume development

## Success Metrics
